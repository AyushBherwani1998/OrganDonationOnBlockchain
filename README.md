# Organ Donation On Blockchain

The black market for organ donation in India and across the world is growing rapidly. Financially weaker group sell their organs to get out of debt. Some doctors taking organs from brain dead patient without permission of their family (or without the patient having signed required docs for willingly donating their organs before death). The records that are maintained of the organs donors and organs receiver is not secure enough and is not transparent. In the current scenario, there is a huge gap between organ donors and people waiting to receive organ which leads to deaths of many patients. The modern systems lack transparency, security [can be easily breached or exploited] and are usually slow which raises a concern in life-threatening situations
The system proposed in this project is a Blockchain-based website to secure and automate the organ donation methodologies. The system is faster with improved scalability, as it can handle increased growth in the amount of work. Transparency is increased, and corruption is almost impossible to occur.
